This post demonstrates various block types available in AsciiDoc, showcasing how they can be used to structure and present content effectively.

== Example Block

Here's an example block, useful for illustrating concepts or providing self-contained demonstrations.

.A Simple Example
====
This is an example block.
It can contain multiple lines of text, and is often used to highlight a specific point or usage.
====

== Quote Block

Next, we have a quote block, perfect for citing external sources or notable sayings.

[quote, Albert Einstein, Out of My Later Years]
____
The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence.
____

== Listing Block (Source Code)

Finally, a listing block, specifically formatted for source code. Notice how it preserves whitespace and can handle very long lines, often with horizontal scrolling in the rendered output.

def calculate_very_complex_result_with_many_parameters_and_a_long_function_name(param1, param2, param3, param4, param5, param6, param7, param8, param9, param10, param11, param12, param13, param14, param15, param16, param17, param18, param19, param20): <1>
    # This is a very long line of code to demonstrate horizontal scrolling in a listing block. <2>
    # In a real scenario, you would break this line for readability, but for demonstration, it's useful.
    result = (param1 * param2 + param3 - param4) / (param5 + param6 * param7) - (param8 / param9 + param10) * (param11 - param12 + param13) + (param14 * param15 / param16) - (param17 + param18 - param19 * param20) <3>
    return result <4>

<1> This is the function definition with many parameters.
<2> This comment explains the purpose of the long line.
<3> This is the complex calculation line.
<4> The function returns the calculated result.

== Admonition Blocks

Admonition blocks are used to highlight important information.

NOTE: This is a note. It's used for general information.

TIP: This is a tip. It provides helpful advice.

WARNING: This is a warning. It indicates potential issues.

CAUTION: This is a caution. It advises against dangerous actions.

IMPORTANT: This is an important block. It highlights critical information.

== Nested Blocks: Admonition with Source Code

It's also possible to nest blocks within each other. Here's an example of a TIP admonition block containing a source code listing.

[TIP]
====
Here's a helpful code snippet:

[source,javascript]
----
function veryLongFunctionNameForDemonstrationOnly(paramA, paramB, paramC, paramD, paramE, paramF, paramG, paramH, paramI, paramJ, paramK, paramL, paramM, paramN, paramO, paramP, paramQ, paramR, paramS, paramT) {
  // This is another very long line to show nesting and horizontal scrolling.
  const result = (paramA + paramB) * paramC - (paramD / paramE) + (paramF * paramG * paramH) - (paramI + paramJ + paramK + paramL + paramM + paramN + paramO + paramP + paramQ + paramR + paramS + paramT);
  return result;
}

This concludes our demonstration of AsciiDoc block types.
