This post demonstrates how to use callouts and description lists in AsciiDoc.

== Callouts

Callouts are used to add annotations to literal text and source code. They are indicated by numbers in angle brackets.

=== JavaScript Example

[source,js]
----
function greet(name) { <1>
  if (!name) { <2>
    return "Hello, World!";
  }
  return `Hello, ${name}!`; <3>
}
----
<1> A function named `greet` that takes one argument.
<2> If the name is not provided, it returns a default greeting.
<3> Otherwise, it returns a personalized greeting using a template literal.

=== XML Example

[source,xml]
----
<book>
  <title>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</title> <1>
  <author>Douglas Adams</author> <2>
</book>
----
<1> The title of the book.
<2> The author of the book.

=== Callouts in an Admonition Block

[TIP]
====
You can place source code with callouts inside any admonition block.

[source,cs]
----
public class Greeter
{
    public string Greet(string name) // <1>
    {
        return $"Hello, {name}!"; // <2>
    }
}
----
<1> The method signature.
<2> Uses C# string interpolation.
====

=== Line Comment Callouts

For certain languages, you can place the callout marker inside a line comment. This prevents the marker from being interpreted as code.

[source,js]
----
function calculate(a, b) {
  return a + b; // <1>
}

const result = calculate(5, 10); // <2>
----
<1> Returns the sum of a and b.
<2> Calls the function with two arguments.

=== Custom Delimiter Line Comment Callouts

You can specify a custom comment delimiter if the language requires it.

[source,python,line-comment=##]
----
def say_hello(name):
  print(f"Hello, {name}") ## <1>

say_hello("World") ## <2>
----
<1> Prints a greeting.
<2> Calls the function.

=== Multi-line and Block Content in Callouts

You can add multiple paragraphs to a single callout annotation by using a list continuation (`+`). Note that nesting complex blocks like source code may not be supported.

[source,ruby]
----
class ComplexExample
  def initialize # <1>
    @data = [1, 2, 3]
    @name = "Example" # <2>
  end

  def to_s # <3>
    "#{@name}: #{@data.join(', ')}"
  end
end
----
<1> The initializer for `ComplexExample`.
+
This is the second paragraph for the first callout.
<2> A simple instance variable assignment.
+
It sets a default name for the instance.
<3> A `to_s` method for string representation.
+
This allows the object to be printed nicely to the console.


== Description Lists

Description lists are used to define terms and their corresponding descriptions.

=== Horizontal List

[horizontal]
Operating Systems::
  Linux:: An open-source Unix-like operating system.
  macOS:: The proprietary operating system for Apple's Mac computers.
  Windows:: A family of proprietary operating systems developed by Microsoft.

Hardware::
  CPU:: The brain of the computer.
  RAM:: Temporary memory for running applications.
  Storage:: Long-term storage for data (e.g., SSD, HDD).

=== Numbered Term List

A description list can also use numbers or other labels as the term.

[horizontal]
1:: The first item in the list.
2:: The second item, which can have a longer description.
3:: The third and final item.

=== Basic Description List

This is a standard description list without any special attributes.

Term 1:: Description for Term 1.
Term 2:: Description for Term 2. This can be a longer description that wraps to multiple lines.

=== Mixing Lists

You can mix different types of lists within a description list.

Term 1::
  Description for Term 1.
  * Item A
  * Item B
Term 2::
  Description for Term 2.
  . Step 1
  . Step 2

=== Nested Description List

Description lists can be nested within other description lists.

Outer Term::
  Outer Description.
  Inner Term 1::: Inner Description 1.
  Inner Term 2::: Inner Description 2.
    Deep Term:::: Deep Description.

=== Question and Answer Lists

A common use case for description lists is Q&A.

What is AsciiDoc?:: A human-readable markup language.
Why use it?:: For technical documentation, books, articles, and more.
